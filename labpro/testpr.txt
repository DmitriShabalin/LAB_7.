Our cats are amazing creatures endowed with a rich inner world and subtle preferences. As intelligent and sensitive creatures, they have a wide range of sympathies that can vary greatly. At the same time, they may have just as many antipathies! Most cats share with us the love of fresh, appetizing food, long sleep in cozy places and a variety of exciting activities, but this is only a small fraction of what brings them real pleasure.
Like humans, cats' interests can change as they grow up. A toy that caused genuine delight yesterday may seem boring and uninteresting today. Therefore, it becomes an important task for the owner to recognize these changes in order to provide the pet with a happy, healthy and eventful life corresponding to its current preferences.
